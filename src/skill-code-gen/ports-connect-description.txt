The document describes how to choose the port names and their connections, by means of the scxml nomenclature.
The section named as " <datamodel> <!--  Services:  --> " is dedicated to open ports from the skill to the components, using the " <data ... /> " space.
Each space defines a service that generates automatically a connection from the skill described by the scxml that the user is filling to the desired component.

Below is listed an example of a service, with all the necessary information.

<datamodel>

<!--  Services:  -->

      <data id="goTo"
            scope_yarp:service_type="GoTo"
            scope_yarp:connect_type="tcp"
            scope_yarp:thrift_protocol="GoTo"
            scope_yarp:service_function="multiple"
            scope_yarp:port_name_client_attribute="location"
            scope_yarp:port_name_server="/GoToComponent"
            />

</datamodel>

The service provides the interface between the skill and the component named "GoTo", defined in "service_type" field.
The "connect_type" field defines the kind of the carrier used for the communication, in this case the "tcp" protocol.
The component is capable to communicate thanks to its "thrift_protocol".
The connection will open 2 ports. One port is associated to the skill (client) and the other to the component (server side).

Client port:

The client port is initialized with the name default name "/ SKILL_NAME + Client", in this case would be "/GoToClient".
Additionally, an attribute is associated to the standard prefix name, as specified in port_name_client_attribute. If it is left to "default", then the port is not further specified.
In this case, "port_name_client_attribute" contains the variable "location", that should be specified in the <!--  Attributes:  --> section.
The client port will result to be named as: "/GoToClient/location", where location might be inizialized at the application start-up.
This functionality is particularly useful to differentiate the execution of multiple instances of the same component.

Server port:

The port connected at the server side is named using the field "scope_yarp:port_name_server". By convention, it contains the name of the component involved.



<datamodel>

<!--  Attributes:  -->

<data id="location"
      scope:cpp_type="const std::string"
      expr="none"
      scope:init_source="parse_as_option"
      />

</datamodel>

Each attribute contains the initialization directives for a variable needed by the state machine.
The field "id" contains the name of the variable of the type specified in "scope:cpp_type".

A variable might be initialized inside the header file of the skill (will be added automatically), if the source is filled with scope:init_source="initialize_inside_header".
The initialization tackles the value of "expr" (it should be consistent with the cpp_type).

Altenatively, scope:init_source="parse_as_option" imply that the "expr" field is not considered, while the attribute is parsed by the application start-up file,
that contains the command line commands. In our implementation, this role is accomplished by the docker-compose.yml.

As an example, the location variable is parsed (for each GoTo executable) by:

gammaray /usr/local/src/bt-implementation/build/bin/GoToSkill --skill-name GoToDestination --location kitchen"

In this case "kitchen" is the destination of the skill.
